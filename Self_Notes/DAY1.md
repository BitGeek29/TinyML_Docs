## Project Planning

### Scope:-
Build a Litter Heatmap.
Learn how to create a prototype of a roadside litter detection device that maps trash in cities 

The Problem
Litter build-ups are not only eye sores but can cause detrimental impacts on the local ecology. There are resources addressed to cleaning these build-ups; however, the current system uses citizen complaints to public services to designate pickup locations, which can be slow and ineffective.

In 2001, 200 million tax dollars were spent on picking up litter nationwide. The cost has only increased, with Californiaâ€™s Caltrans spending 102 million dollars on roadside pickup in the 2019 fiscal year alone. This project aims to solve that by creating a heatmap of trash in cities, which can be a more reliable measure of trash, and help locate where to direct these resources where they are most needed in a faster, more efficient way.

### Conslusion:-

We are only going to create and train the model not the hardware.
